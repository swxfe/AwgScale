## Which install method are you using?

The Network Extension entitlement controls whether AwgScale can create a system-wide VPN tunnel.

### TrollStore — full features, no Apple account needed

TrollStore installs the app persistently with all entitlements intact. No Apple Developer account is required, and no re-signing is ever needed.

**All features available:**
- System-wide Packet Tunnel VPN — exit nodes, DNS, subnet routes, Tailnet Lock
- Built-in SSH terminal and browser (tailnet + public via exit node)
- Taildrop, AWG config sync, peer diagnostics

### Paid Apple Developer account (Sideloadly, Xcode, etc.)

A paid Apple Developer Program account ($99/year) can request the Network Extension capability for an App ID in the Developer Portal. Signing with that provisioning profile — via Sideloadly, Xcode, or any other tool — produces a fully functional build with system-wide VPN. The certificate is valid for one year.

**All features available** (same as TrollStore), with annual re-signing required.

> In Sideloadly: choose your paid team, import the provisioning profile that includes the Network Extension capability, then sign.

### Free Apple ID signing (Sideloadly default, AltStore personal team, etc.)

Free accounts cannot request the Network Extension entitlement. The app runs in **app-only mode**: tailnet access works inside the app only, no system-wide VPN is created, and certificates expire after 7 days.

**Available in app-only mode:**
- Built-in SSH terminal (connects to tailnet hosts directly)
- Built-in browser with tailnet HTTP access and exit-node public browsing (iOS 17+)
**Not available without Network Extension:**
- System-wide VPN tunnel, exit node routing for other apps

## Build

```sh
# Build the Go framework
./build_go.sh --all

# Build a TrollStore-ready unsigned IPA
./build_unsigned_ipa.sh
# Output: build/unsigned-ipa/AwgScale-trollstore.ipa
```

Quick validation:

```sh
go test ./libtailscale/...
xcodebuild build -project AwgScale.xcodeproj -scheme AwgScale \
  -configuration Debug -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' \
  CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO
```

App-only UI can be developed in the Simulator. The system VPN tunnel requires a device with a valid Network Extension entitlement.
